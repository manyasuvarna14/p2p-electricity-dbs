You are a database architect designing a **Peer-to-Peer Electricity Trading Platform** using MySQL.

Your task is to generate a **complete, normalized relational database schema with at least 30 tables**. The design should be suitable for a **second-year engineering DBMS project**, but still realistic and well-structured.

## 📌 System Description

The platform allows users to:

* Register as buyers, sellers, or prosumers (both)
* Sell excess electricity (e.g., solar power)
* Buy electricity from nearby users
* Perform secure transactions
* Track usage, payments, and history

---

## 📌 Requirements

### 1. Core Entities

Include (but not limited to):

* Users
* Roles (buyer/seller/prosumer/admin)
* Smart meters
* Energy production
* Energy consumption
* Energy listings (sell offers)
* Orders / purchase requests
* Transactions
* Payments
* Wallets / balances

---

### 2. Advanced Entities (to reach ~30 tables)

Include additional realistic modules:

* Location / region / grid zones
* Pricing models / tariffs
* Time slots (peak/off-peak)
* Contracts between users
* Ratings & reviews
* Notifications
* Dispute management
* Energy storage (batteries)
* Renewable sources (solar/wind)
* Audit logs
* System configuration
* API logs
* Device management (IoT meters)
* Forecasting / demand prediction
* Energy transfer pipeline tracking

---

### 3. Database Design Rules

* Use **3NF normalization**
* Clearly define:

  * Primary keys
  * Foreign keys
  * Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)
* Use appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATETIME, etc.)
* Avoid redundancy

---

### 4. Output Format (VERY IMPORTANT)

Provide:

#### ✅ A. Table List

* List all 30+ tables with short description

#### ✅ B. SQL Schema

* Provide **MySQL CREATE TABLE statements** for all tables
* Include keys and constraints

#### ✅ C. Relationships

* Clearly explain relationships:

  * One-to-One
  * One-to-Many
  * Many-to-Many

#### ✅ D. ER Model Explanation

* Describe how to draw ER diagram from schema

---

### 5. Data Pipelines (IMPORTANT FOR PROJECT)

Design logical pipelines such as:

* Energy generation → listing → matching → transaction → payment
* Buyer request → matching engine → seller allocation
* Meter data → usage logs → billing

---

### 6. Packages / Modules (for structuring project)

Group tables into logical modules:

* User Management
* Energy Management
* Trading System
* Payment System
* Monitoring & Analytics

---

### 7. Bonus (Optional but preferred)

* Add sample INSERT statements (few rows)
* Add indexing suggestions
* Add triggers or stored procedures (basic level)

---

## ⚠️ Constraints

* Keep it understandable for a student project
* Avoid overly complex enterprise-level jargon
* Ensure it can run in MySQL Workbench

---

## 🎯 Goal

The output should help generate an ER diagram directly in MySQL Workbench and serve as the backend for a P2P electricity trading application.
